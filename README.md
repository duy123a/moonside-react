> You can watch live demo here: <https://moonside-react.vercel.app>

## Getting Started

You can review the app by using these command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/App.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your frontend app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) from the creators of Next.js.

As a side note, since Vercel doesn't know react-router-dom by default, you need to config your vercel.json in root directory. After that you can reload the page normally.

```bash
{"rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]}
```
